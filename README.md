# stationeers-scripts

[Integrated Circuit (IC10)](https://stationeers-wiki.com/IC10) scripts for stationeers. Some assembly required.

IC10 is a MIPS-like assembly language. In-game computers or laptops with IC Editor Motherboards can load these
scripts into IC10 chips, which can then be placed into IC Housings, which allow access to the network of devices.
Scripts are limited to 128 lines of code, or 4096 bytes of data, whichever comes first. To respect the in-game editor
lines are limited to 52 characters.
